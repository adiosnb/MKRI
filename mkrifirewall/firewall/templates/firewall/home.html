                    <p>
                        Firewall application is implemented as a web based interface to nftables framework, which is a
                        part
                        of Netfilter subsystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Primary programming language used in backend is Python and Shell,
                        where frontend is implemented with Django, HighCharts, Bootstrap, Ajax and similar frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Django is used to display queries from the nft userspace utility, that controls Netfilter's
						packet filtering based on newer implementation of firewall in form of nftables.
                    </p>
                    <p>Due to keeping the test environment
                        simple
                        enough, firewall is implemented in netfilter's input and output hooks, instead of forward one.
                        This alteration allows user to observe incoming and outgoing traffic from network endpoint,
                        instead
                        of a need to create real network with typically transparent forwarding firewall.

				<b>Vagrant</b> is the chosen tool to create replicable virtualized environment for the ease of testing and
				presenting the application. It provisions libvirt based virtual machine with specified usecase, either
				generator or firewall itself.
            </p>
			<p>
				<b>Generator</b> VM is used to generate traffic with iperf3 framework, to verify functionality of application.
				It is connected directly to the firewall VM, where one endpoint of IPsec tunnel is present as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Firewall</b> VM instance is running the nft ruleset itself, which is doing the actual traffic filtering.
				Other endpoint of IPsec tunnel is located here, along with the webserver instance generated from Django.
